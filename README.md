# scpcaData package

This is an R data package that contains pre-processed single cell data in formats expected by [scpcaTools](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/scpcaTools/).

Data are processed with [`alevin-fry`](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/alevin-fry), [`kallisto bustools`](https://www.kallistobus.tools/) and [`cellranger`](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger), using workflows from https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/alsf-scpca/tree/main/workflows

Sample data used is from a small 10X Genomics sample data set for invasive ductal carcinoma, available for download from the 10X website:
